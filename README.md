Introduction
In this project, you'll learn how to build a website that shortens URLs. Optimizing the length of your website's URLs is useful on space-sensitive forums, helps websites rank better in search results, and are also easier for users to type out.

Requirements
The user will input a valid URL and click a "shorten" button. The shortened URL will then be displayed.

Your UI should include the following elements:

Text input for the user's URL
"Shorten" button to trigger the link shortening
Display area to return the shortened URL to the user
For extra challenge:

Make it easier for the user to copy the shortened URL by adding a "copy" button for one-click copying.
Try to allow the user to automatically copy the shortened URL by using libraries like SimpleCopy or ClipboardJS.
